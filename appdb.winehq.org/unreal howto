<strong>Patching</strong>
­<br />
­­­<br />
If you are going to be hostin­g a server, you will want to use the 225 patch to avoid a network incompatibility bug, otherwise players with the Gold version will not be able to join.

<br />
<br />
If you are just playing the game, you will want to use the 226f ­patch because it is compatible with most mods and the updated OpenGL renderers detailed below.

<strong>Updated Graphics (Optional)</strong>
­<br />
<br />
The stock OpenGL renderer was never really finished. However, you can replace i­t with an alter­native that boasts new features.

Extract 'OpenGLDrv.dll' and 'OpenGlDrv.int' to the '[installdir]/System' directory. Enable the renderer by setting "<i>GameRenderDevice</i>" to "<i>OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice</i>" in '[installdir]/System/Unreal.ini'. If you happen to have the second Unreal Tournament disc, you can use high-detail textures. Read 'S3TCext.txt' provided with the zip file for instructions on how to convert and use the textures. For more information on tuning the renderer (anistrophic filtering, anti-aliasing, etc) refer to the OpenGL section in <a href="http://oldunreal.com/patch/Oldunreal-Multimediaupdate.pdf">http://oldunreal.com/patch/Oldunreal-Multimediaupdate.pdf</a>.

<strong>Issues</strong>
<br />
<br />
In more recent wine, using the software renderer may crash the game with a segmentation fault. Use the OpenGL renderer detailed above, or set "<i>GameRenderDevice</i>" to "<i>D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice</i>" in '[installdir]/System/Unreal.ini'.
<br />
<br />
For users of some intel or ati/amd graphics drivers, the game may display a black screen upon startup. Set the registry key "<i>HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software>Wine>AppDefaults>Unreal.exe>Direct3D>OffscreenRenderingMode</i>" to "<i>backbuffer</i>" to fix this.
<br />
<br />
This game is based on an older game engine and may run at erratic speeds. This is usually due to the high performance of modern systems, but is also complicated by things like cpu frequency scaling and multicore processors. Before starting the game, change to the performance cpu frequency scaling governor, and if neccessary, limit the game to one core/cpu. If you are using the enhanced OpenGL renderer, you can have it limit the frame rate by setting "<i>FrameRateLimit</i>" to "<i>60</i>" and/or "<i>SwapInterval</i>" to "<i>1</i>" under the "<i>[OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice]</i>" section in '[installdir]/System/Unreal.ini'.
