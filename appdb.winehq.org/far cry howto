<br />
<br /><strong>Installation:</strong>­­
<br />­
<br />
If ­you use the CD/DVD version run the setup program on the DVD or the first CD, and be sure it doesn't install Adobe Acrobat or DirectX.

<br /><strong>Patching:</strong>
<br />
<br />
Version 1.4 is required for multiplayer and contains many engine improvements. The version downloaded from Steam is also 1.40.

<br /><strong>Optional OpenGL Renderer:</strong>­
<br />
<br />
There is an OpenGL renderer that has most of the visual effects present in the Direct3D one, but should run faster. To enable it, change "r_Driver" from "Direct3D9" to "OpenGL" in the 'system.cfg' file.
<br />
<br />
The older OpenGL renderer in version 1.0/1.1 exhibits less artifacts, whereas 1.33 and above have a problematic water shader, and portions of far-off terrain render incorrectly. Regardless of the game version, set the shadow quality to 'medium' and the lighting quality to 'high'.
<br />
<br /><strong>Issues:</strong>
<br />
<br />
The steam version will attempt to install a VisualC++ redistributable when starting the game. It is not clear if this game would benefit from it, but if you don't like clutter in your wine prefix, you can delete 'steamapps/farcry/vcredist' to avoid the prompt.
