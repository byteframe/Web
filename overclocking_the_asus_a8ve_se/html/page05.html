          After you have set your intial baseline system configuration, you can
          start overclocking! Starting nudging the baseclock up by 5 Mhz intervals.
          For every 5 Mhz, you get a 60 increase on the CPU, and a small percentage
          increase to your RAM.

          The basic method of overclocking a computer is to overclock it component
          by component, and to have the other component running at lower speeds
          to rule out them as potential points of failure when your tweaking for
          an overclock. For instance, to isolate the CPU as a target for enhancing
          speed, you'll want to lower the inital speed of your HTT link, and 
          your memory.
          <br />
          <br />
          After you've made a significant jump in your baseclock. You should test
          your CPU for stability. Using tools like Prime95 for the CPU, and
          memtest86 for the system memory, the stability of your entire system
          can be profiled and benchmarked.        
          <br />
          <br />
          As a general rule of them, when you've come to what you think is a stable
          overclocked system, a test of Prime95 on test # 1 for 10 hours or more
          should be obtained. At least 50 passes on memtest86 will ensure your
          memory is running top-notch, and finally a 10 hour or more test of 
          Prime95 on test # 3 will test both your CPU and memory.
