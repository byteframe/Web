          Overclocking is the process of making parts of a computer system
          operate faster then originally intended, in an effort to gain
          more performance out of the equipment.  Overclocking has traditionally
          revolved around making the processor, memory, and graphics processor of
          a given computer system run faster than their stock speeds.
          <br />

          Usually, manufacturers of computer components rate their chips for
          specific capabilities, based on the quality of the silicon chip, 
          but are otherwise the same thing as much higher rated, and priced units.
          <br />
          <br />
          The majority of overclocking ventures centers around raising the 'clock
          rate' of a given component. The clock rate of a processor, for instance,
          could be rated at 2.4 Gigahertz, but through a sucessful overclock, could
          run at 3.0 Gigahertz. Such is the power of overclocking, with proper
          forethought for cooling -- and with enough time to tweak and test -- extra
          and most importantnly, free preformance can be gained from your existing
          hardware.

              <strong>WARNING</strong><br />
              While some components, namely processors, come from one or two sources
              and are usually capable to be overclocked, a system running on cheap
              power, and insufficenet cooling can easily stomp on the potential of
              your overclock.

          Overclocking can be very dangerous if certain parameters are taken too far!
          Practicing caution always, and learning the basics before you start
          increasing the strain on your system is paramount!
