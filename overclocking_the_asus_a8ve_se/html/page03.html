          The ASUS K8V-e has a number of differant Overclocking options. Generally
          this board is highly suitable for overclocking, yet the names of some
          <img src="../image/biosThumbs.png" id="rightFloat" />
          of the options are somewhat confusing, and spread out among differant 
          sections.
          <br />
          <br />           
          Many of these options are in the "Automatic" mode provided by ASUS.
          In the next section, we will start by deactivating the automatic mode,
          and set everything up to a baseline configuration in "Manual" mode, but
          for now, we will explore the BIOS options.
          <br />
          <br />
          First, under JumperFree, the CPU Multiplier can be raised or lowered, 
          but only raised for Athlon 64 FX processors. In addition voltages for
          the memory and CPU can be confiqured here. Higher voltages are required
          in order to provided overclocked CPU's with more power in order to function, 
          but create higher tempatures and even the slightest raises. The vcore
          is computed in a somewhat strange way on the A8V-E and can be found by 
          taking the sum of the "Hammer Vid Control" + the CPU Vcore offset. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Under "Frequency Configuration", the clocks for both the PCI, and PCI
          Express bus can, and should, be locked to 33 Mhz and 100 Mhz
          respectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          The system memory's starting frequency, and timings can be confiqured
          in Chipset > DRAM Configuration. Also the speed of the HyperTransport
          bus can be set to intial values before the overclock.
