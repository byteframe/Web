          Overclocking 
          The Athlon 64 chip, also known as the K8, from AMD is an excellent chip
          that in many instances, overclocks very nicely. With the memory 
          controller directly embedded on the chip, the K8 is fast.

          <br />
          <br />
          When overclocking an K8 based system, there are a few numbers you have
          to deal with. First there is the <strong>base clock</strong> which
          is sometimes referred to as the HyperTransport, HT or HTT clock. This 
          is synonmous with the Front Side Bus term used with Intel systems, which
          do not have integrated memory controllers.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the base clock, which starts at 200 for Socket 939 Athlon64 Systems
          the speed of the CPU and memory can be inferred. The speed of the CPU
          is equal to the product of the base clock and the CPU's internal multipiler.
          For instance, the Athlon 64 4000+ has an internal CPU multiplier or 12.
          Therefore, it's starting speed is 2.4 Ghz. Unless youre running an
          Athlon 64 FX, the CPU multiplier is locked, and cannot be changed, so
          increases in the base clock are needed to overclock the CPU.
          <br />
          <br />
          Memory is also influenced by the base clock. Memory for the ASUS K8V, is
          of the DDR variety. DDR runs in speeds of either 166, or more usually, 200
          Mhz. Due to the way DDR operates, this can be effectivly doubled, and
          DDR memory is usually labelled as DDR333 (166 mhz) or DDR400 (200 mhz).
          The running speed of the memory is still quantified in the actual Mhz
          value, and is found by taking the quotient of the CPU-Clock rate divided 
          by the CPU-unique memory divider.
