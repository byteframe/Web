          Most motherboards that are designed for overclocking generally have the
          related options (see previous section) set at some kinda of default
          automatic mode, that sets parameters to safe values based on the
          hardware (CPU, memory) used.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, since we will be turning off these automatic defaults, we should
          establish a baseline, for a non-overclocked system. A baseline is setup
          properly for your exact CPU and memory's specifications. First, we must
          use the proper voltage for your CPU. This varies, but for the 4000+
          its 1.35 volts. Therefore, the Hammer Vid Control should be set to 1.25,
          so the Vcore offset can then bring it up to 1.35. The multiplier can then
          be set to the CPU's internal one, in the case of the 4000, that is 12x.

          The baseclock should be kept at 200, until we start to raise it later.
          <br />
          <br />
          Depending on whether or not your running DDR333, or hopefully DDR400,
          you should set the RAM clock speed to either 166 or 200 Mhz, and memory
          timings should be set to what your SPD (serial precense detect) has in
          its memory. The SPD is information stored within your RAM DIMM, that contains
          it's recommended settings for memory timings based on the differant clock
          speeds. If your are unfamiliar with what your RAM timings should 
          default too, or you can't find the spec sheet, run CPU-Z in Windows,
          while your BIOS is still set to overclock mode. CPU-Z will list just about
          all the information you'll need to help you overclock.
          <br />
          <br />          
          One of the most important -- and easy -- things to do, is to lock
          the PCI, and PCI-Express buses, at 33 Mhz, and 100 Mhz respectivily.
          Not only is this very important for setting a baseline, chances are
          you won't be overclocking your devices via raising the frequcny of the PCI
          bus, so it makes sense to keep this locked down to avoid any hard to
          diagnose problems.<br />
